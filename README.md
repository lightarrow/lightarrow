### Author Ronald Johnson on human behavior data. 
We will use a data pipeline to process our data. 



Supervised Learning: Best when labeled data is available; useful for classification.
Unsupervised Learning: Detects anomalies without labels; valuable for spotting new, unseen threats.
Sequential / Time-Series Models: Capture temporal trends in behavior, such as shifts patterns.
Graph-Based Models: Model relationships between people and their environment.
Hybrid & Ensemble Approaches: Combine multiple methods for improved detection and fewer false positives.
